%% get_probabilities:

% V160:
% The purpose of this function is essentially to clean up the output of the get_edges and
% get_vertices functions.  The strategy is to break up the image into networks based on their
% connectivity (from an adjacency matrix formed by the edges that were found before).  We will view
% each network as a stochastic process where the transition matrix is formed by weighting the
% adjacency matrix by the boltzmann factors associated with the average energies on the edges
% connecting two vertices (taken as the best trajectory found between each vertex based on average
% energy).  The energies are normalized in the same way as the get_edges algorithm, where they are
% divided by the origin vertex energy scaled by some characteristic fraction. SAM 5/11/18
%
% V161 where the edges have already been chosen before this function in the function choose_edges
% after the get_edges function, and what remains is to make the transition matrix from all of the
% edges that are passed. SAM 5/15/18
%
% function name changed from get_probabilities to get_strands. SAM 5/22/18
%
% V170 in which transitions from vertex A to A are not allowed, and the purpose of the transition
% matrix is for each vertex to select its top two vertices.  Vertices that select each other then
% belong to the same strand.  These strands are then easily found by looking at the connected
% components of transition matrix with only the top two edges from each vertex nonzero.  SAM 5/22/18
%
% function name changed from get_strands to get_network SAM 5/31/18
%
% V180 in which the junctions are also retrieved (in addition to the strands) by looking at the
% edges in the top 4 connectivity network that meet all of the following conditions
%
% 1) not found in the top 2 connectivity network
% 2) not connecting a strand to itself (all single vertex strands are considered the same strand)
%
% The connected components of this network are junctions.  The junction sets need to be trimmed to
% have only one edge connecting strand A to B again considering all single vertex strands to be the
% same strand).  After trimming this network is analyzed for connectivity. Any single vertex strands
% that dont contact at least two other strands are removed
%
% % Once we have the junctions, loop through the strands and break them up into the smaller strands
% % just going from junction to junction !!!!! not yet implemente !!!!!
%
% SAM 5/31/18
%
% V181 in which the way the junctions are found is changed.  In this version, we only look at top 3
% connectivity for vertices that had two neighbors in the the top two connectivity network.  The
% edges in this set that were not in the top two connectivity network are the first junction pieces.
% 
%
% !!! not yet implemented section !!!
% Iterating from here to now look at the top 4 connectivity for vertices that had three neighbors in
% the previous connectivity network that included top 3 connectivity for some of the vertices.
% !!! not yet implemented section !!!
%
% SAM 6/12/18
%
% V182 in which an outputs are added, end_vertices_of_junctions and bifurcation_vertices. 
%
% Also removed bugs: 
%
% extra edges were sometimes added to strands in previous version (two neighbors max was not
% guaranteed)
%
% the requirement for the opportunity to form a junction was less strict than intended (some singly
% connected vertices were granted extra edges in the top three connectivity network)
%
% the whole section about edge trimming inside junctinos was removed because I now believe that no
% edges would have been removed in that section anyway.
%
% SAM 7/11/18
%
% Attempting to decrease the runtime in this version. Taking a more direct approach in the FOR
% loops.  Building the adjacency matrices from the strand from bottom up instead of starting with
% the network-wide one and widdling it down. SAM 8/14/18
%
% V190 Complete Overhaul: The network objects of interest are changed and the method for finding
% them has changed. Now there are two objects only: strands and bifurcation vertices.  Strands are
% end-to-end collections of edges that don't bifurcate, and bifurcation vertices are vertices where
% those strands end. These are found by treating all edges as true and then manipulating the
% adjacency matrix to find the vertices with two neighbors.  The connected components when only
% considering two-neighbor vertices gives the strand vertices and associated edges.
