%% for Chakameh, 4/25/18, rendering vascular vectors, from Sam
% this script takes the positions list and puts a sphere on a matrix whose uniform value is equal to
% the corresponding laplacian value of that position.  The output of the 'visualize' functions
% below are TIFF files to be loaded into FIJI or imageJ and can then be overlayed over the original.
%
% for your purposes you may want to eliminate the laplacian as this is a contrast metric for telling
% us how "good" that vector is.  Also, you might want to adapt the visual functions to output the
% 3D image matrix before it is converted into a TIFF.
%
% tangent vector calculations should be performed on the positions in the trajectory form, as this
% is the form that assures that the index within the contents of each position in the cell array
% corresponds to a trajectory index.
%
% Enjoy! 
% SAM 4/25/18

%% V200
% In the second version, we put the contrast thresholding in this script (in V1 it was done before
% you load the data).  We also switched from a list view of the vector objects to a grouped cell
% array view where each cell array bin represents a single edge (a vessel segment between two
% vertices), and inside the bin is the list of physical positions in physical order from one vertex
% to another.
%
% The shortcomings of grouping the vector objects into edges were two-fold: 
% 
% 1) we couldn't easily tell which vertices were bifurcations 
%
% 2) we couldn't easily calculate spatial derivatives with respect to vessel axial direction (our
% approximation for local blood flow direction).
%
% SAM circa 7/5/18 (retro-dated on 7/12/18)

%% V300
% In the third version, we organized the edges into objects called "strands" and "junctions" which
% are both collections of edges arranged head to tail so that following the object down its list of
% vectors will take you along a path from one vertex to another across (possibly many) other
% vertices and edges.  What constitutes inclusion in a strand is that all edges in a strand will be
% either the first or second best edge for all the vertices in that strand and that those vertices
% will be strongly (i.e. mutually) connected by the edges.
%
% After strands are found, all edges involved in strands are erased and then all vertices included
% in strands (excluding the end vertices who have only one neighbor) are granted their next best
% edge.  Any new connections formed in this way that take us from one strand to a different strand
% are called junctions.
%
% Combining the strand and junction networks and then identifying vertices with three edges gives us
% the location of vertices that might represent bifurcations.  The contrast metric that would be
% appropriate for determining if the bifurcation is authentic or artifactual would be the max_energy
% for the edge(s) in the junction object that connects to the bifurcation vertex.
%
% The strand and junction organization of edges is encoded in the variables edge_indices_in_strands
% and edge_indices_in_junctions in the chakameh_V300.mat file.  Likewise there are variables that
% encode the organization of the vertices into strands and junctions.  These encoding variables
% index the edges or vertices used to construct each strand or junction objects.  The list of
% vectors to which these encoding variables index are the edge_subscripts variable and the
% vertex_subscript variable.  If when an edge is called in the formation of a strand its order needs
% to be flipped before correctly fitting into the list, this is will be encoded in the variable
% edge_backwards_in_strands (or edge_backwards_in_junctions). 
%
% V400: specific to 170315 dataset: max energy variable name changed to mean energy.  contrast limit
% set to zero (no thresholding).  Fixed flow-field and tissue type rendering resolution at 1 um^3
% voxel size.  Made the interpolation step more robust by adding objects when the interpolation
% creats gaps between objects.  Also added a manual edge for a large surface vessel before this
% script but will not do the smoothing operation on that edge in this script.  SAM 1/2/19
%
% V500: Removed the special treatment for manually added edges, as those methods have been improved
% and now the manually added edges have the same data format as the automatically generated ones.
% Therefore this script should be compatible with any input dataset, provided the .mat file is
% correctly located and loaded. SAM 2/27/19
